# cpnt262-rest-api: Stephans API

## Code Journal Plan

### Goal

To create an interactive API that cycles through the API on a click of a button

1. Copy finished Disney API Boiler
2. Find a API I want to use
3. Copy API to the link

### Struggles

- I at first struggled with getting the APIs to work. So I sought the help of my brother. It turns out that I was choosing APIs that were much to complex for my current level. He suggested I choose something easier...which lead me to the Digimon API
  - He showed me a different REST API method from what you showed that class. Which was great and taught me other methods of using `FetchData` functions.
    - This worked, but it printed out the entire page of objects rather then a single one.
  - I instead went back to my original JS layout, but played around with it a bunch to function the way I wanted with great success I might add!
    - You'll notice the previous JS commented out below the new one.
- I was able to make the `btn` selector work successfully to cycle through each objects all on my own. I was quite proud of myself to do it on my own.
